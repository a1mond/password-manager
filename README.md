# Password Manager

The application stores all the records into two .csv databases, one is for users, and the second one is for passwords.
Passwords for both users and their passwords are XOR'ed by a key inside the Consts.h header. You can specify it easily for your prefers.
In the next builds, I'll try to implement some more serious encryption.
